Figure out if clustalW is a better alignment method than the current one.
Add a check to make sure that "NNN" is always in frame with the others
There is a bug when you don't have any "NNN" in your reference sequence. Make sure 
    we check to make sure the user put in the variable regions.

Tests to make:
1. Are the counts coming back correct?
2. Do we appropriately handle insertions and deletions?
3. Is the reference sequence any good? Were we able to make any alignments at all?
4. Make sure --fastq_r is ignored if the folder argument is a folder
5. Remind users about the detailed-refseq flag if our reference sequence file fails
   for some reason
6. Does ts mode work?
    1. Are we getting the right consensus sequences
    2. How about the matrices?

Pre-Demo:
- Work out how to install on different computers
    - Will need a series of instructions on how to actuall install all dependencies
- Make all tests
