# evSeq
## **E**very **v**ariant **Seq**uencing: No sequence-function pair left behind.

Every variant Sequencing (evSeq) provides resources for extremely low cost massively parallel sequencing of protein/enzyme variants arrayed in 96-well plates. This library preparation technique and data processing tool enables sequencing all variants produced during a protein engineering or biochemical mutagenesis experiment at a cost of cents per variant, even for labs that do not have expertise in or access to next generation sequencing (NGS) technology.

## Installation
For non-programmers and those unfamiliar with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), see the [programing basics page](#basics.md) for information on how to set up your computer environment to run evSeq.
